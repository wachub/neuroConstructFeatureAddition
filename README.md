# neuroConstructFeatureAddition
Final year Project
# Guys, here's my take on this..

We will get to the main NeuroConstruct repository a bit later. Before that we will try to have a standalone Java application that performs the same function .

The to-do list will be something like this

  - Create a Standalone app that performs the required functions
  - Try integrating these changes into our fork of neuroConstruct
  - Try to push the changes into the main copy of the software
